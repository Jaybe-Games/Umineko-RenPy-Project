On 04 October 1986, the Ushiromiya family gathers on the island of Rokkenjima for the annual family conference. This year, Ushiromiya Battler, who has left the family for six years for family reasons, is back. While travelling to the island, a typhoon that had been forecast for midday days before hits much too early in the morning. A passenger plane that had been given the green light to take off had to make an emergency landing due to excessive turbulence and crashed on the island. Only one young man survived this accident, his name is Ayato. During his time on the island, Ayato witnesses mysterious murders that threaten everyone on the island. Does he have to watch as a non-human witch kills everyone one by one in locked rooms, or is there perhaps a dark truth behind it that no one could have foreseen?
